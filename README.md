# Pharmacy_Management_System
A pharmacy management system is a comprehensive software solution that optimizes pharmacy operations, including the capability for patients to order medications. This system streamlines prescription processing, automates inventory management, and maintains patient records securely. Patients can conveniently request medicines through an online portal or mobile app, enhancing accessibility and reducing in-person visits. Pharmacists can efficiently manage medication stock, track expiration dates, and place orders as needed. The system also ensures the confidentiality of patient data and prescription history, while offering features such as drug interaction alerts and insurance claim processing. It ultimately simplifies pharmacy workflows, promoting patient convenience and safety while maintaining regulatory compliance.
